Parnitha in the north, Mt.Aigaleo in the west, Mt. Penteli in the northeast and Mt. Hymettus in the east. The climate is Mediterranean, pleasant and healthy, perhaps the best in the Mediterrenean Sea, with ample sunshine throughout the year. Athens is a metropolis of about four million inhabitants, a crowded, bustling city yet a hospitable destination for thousands of holidaymakers who are attracted by its innumerable charms and sites all year long.</p>\n<p>Athens is a place of enormous archaeological and historic interest, rightly called a vast archaeological museum, with indisputable highlight, the eternal symbol of the city: the &#8220;sacred rock&#8221; of Acropolis. The city&#8217;s unbreakable habitation is testified by marks of various historic periods: the ancient Greek, the Roman, the Byzantine, and the Ottoman yoke to the present day.</p>\n<p>Athens is a worldwide symbol of democracy, freedom and art rendering the treasures of the city, cultural heritage belonging not only to Greece but to the whole world. There are countless interesting sites and a plethora of historic monuments as well as ample sport facilities and vibrant nightlife. Wandering in the charming narrow streets in Plaka is delightful. Piraeus, the major Greek port and an important industrial and commercial centre promises delightful moments along its lively coast. From the foot of Mt Parnitha, Mt Hymettus and the densely wooded slopes of Mt Penteli to the coastline of Attica, a series of scenic surprises welcome the visitors. You can find nice beaches in Glyfada, Voulagmeni, Sounio, Schinias etc., wonderful resorts in Vouliagmeni, Kifissia, Ekali etc. as well as picturesque landscapes and monasteries on Mt.
