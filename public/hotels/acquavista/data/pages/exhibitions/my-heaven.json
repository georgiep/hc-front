It is an integral part of many religions. In antiquity there were the Champs-Elysées, with flowering gardens, where everlasting spring, joy and beauty prevailed. At the same time Paradise is also the place where the human soul seeks ultimate happiness. Every space of greatest satisfaction is today a paradise.Our home, a landscape, loved faces, colors, anything that touches us and makes us touch happiness can be our Paradise. A piece of or even whole paradises will touch and feel through the works of modern artists, because Paradise may not only be a local identification but also a way of approaching the mystery surrounding the human soul. “</span></p>\n<div id=\"tw-target-text-container\" class=\"tw-ta-container tw-nfl\">\n<pre class=\"tw-ta tw-text-small\" lang=\"en\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3069\" src=\"https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_5-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_5-300x198.jpg 300w, https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_5-768x508.jpg 768w, https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_5-260x172.jpg 260w, https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_5.jpg 880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vc_row wpb_row section vc_row-fluid \">\n<div class=\" full_section_inner clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\">\n<div class=\"vc_column-inner\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h6 class=\"promo-heading-text font-500\">CURATOR:DIMITRIS LAZAROU</h6>\n<h6 class=\"promo-heading-text font-500\">ARTISTS:MARIA ANDREOU, GIORGOS ANDROUTSOS, ANTONIS ANTZOULIDIS, ELENA ANTONIOU, MAGDA APOSTOLOU, ELENI SAMIELI VAROUXAKI, PALIDA GEORGOULAKOU, EVA DIVARIS, LEONIDAS KABANAKIS, EVITA KANELLOU, ANGELA KARALIS, MICHALIS KOUFAS, CHRISTOS KONTRAUDIS, SOFIA ROSE KOSMIDOU, PANAGIOTA KORONI, MARIKITA MANOLOPOULOU, KATERINA MAVROLEON, NIKI MICHAILIDOU, ASPA PAPALEXANDRI, SERGIOS PAPPAS, NADIA RAPTI, APHRODITE CEZENIA, NIKOS SIALAKAS, KATERINA SOROULA, SOFIA STAVROU, KONSTANTINOS TZALALIS, GIANNIS TZOMAKAS, IOANNA T., STATHIS FOTIS, ARISTIDIS CHRYSANTHOPOULOS.</h6>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","css":{"element":"div","class":"main-text-body","color":"primary-black","heading":{"element":"div","class":"main-text-body animation--up","color":"primary-white"}}}]}]},"3":{"wrapper":{"fluid":false,"css":{"border":"0","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF"},"rows":[{"css":{"padding":"80px 0","border":"0"},"columns":{"sizes":["col-md-12 animation--up"]}}]},"rows":[{"columns":[{"items":[{"book_now":"","title":"FROM SANTORINI TO ATHENS: GREEKS ARTISTS’ TRIPS","description":"Eos art gallery, in collaboration with art historian and curator Marina Kanakaki, participates in the #Restart Platform and presents a group exhibition at Aqua Gallery in Santorini....","image":{"src":"https://code.rateparity.com/aquavistahotels.com/2022/12/santorini_athens.jpg","alt":"alt image sightseeings"},"excerpt":"Eos art gallery, in collaboration with art historian and curator Marina Kanakaki, participates in the #Restart Platform and presents a group exhibition at Aqua Gallery in Santorini....","seo_title":"Aqua Vista Hotels | Hotel Management Company | From Santorini to Athens: Greeks artists' trips | | Aqua Vista Hotels | Hotel Management Company","seo_description":"Eos art gallery, in collaboration with art historian and curator Marina Kanakaki, participates in the #Restart Platform and presents a group exhibition at Aqua Gallery in Santorini.","keywords":"","link":{"pathname":"/exhibitions/from-santorini-to-athens-greeks-artists-trips","api":"/pages/room/room1","text":"Explore"}},{"book_now":"","title":"ART TRAVELING","description":"EPsilon Art Gallery in collaboration with Aqua Gallery curates the group exhibition entitled \"Art Traveling ...”.
