In 2006 and 2007, it was voted the No. 1 European Island Destination and one of the Top 10 Islands in the World by Travel &amp; Leisure Magazine. Santorini is the Island where nature reveals its most mystical and extraordinary secrets. It is known all over the world for its stunning sunsets and the most breathtaking views of the unfathomable blue of the Aegean Sea.</p>\n<p>The Minoan capital of Santorini owes its unique curved shape, famous black-sand beaches, and high, striated black, red, and grey cliffs to the volcano that erupted and created it 3,500 years ago; an event that led Plato to argue that it was the lost city of Atlantis. The Caldera – a seven mile crater enclosed by the two arms of the crescent – serves as the harbor of Santorini and is one of its most defining features. The sunset over the Caldera is a nightly extravaganza accompanied by a festive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Santorini is home to no less than ten wineries. Wines of the Region are dry with mineral overtones, with the exception of Vinsanto which is the dessert wine of Santorini which is well known as it is also the wine of the Holy Communion. Arts and crafts thrive on the Island, with many local artists exhibiting across the island. If you can bear to leave the comfort of your Alta Vista suite, we will be happy to assist with local tours or events that interest you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"primary-dark title-case-secondary text-left\">Address</div>\n<div class=\"line-break\"></div>\n<div class=\"main-text-body primary-black\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\">Alta Vista Suites Santorini, Firostefani, Σαντορίνη 847 00</div>\n","css":{"element":"div","class":"animation--up","color":"primary-dark"}}]}]},"4":{"wrapper":{"fluid":true,"css":{"border":"0","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF"},"rows":[{"css":{"padding":"80px 0 0 0","border":"0"},"columns":{"sizes":["col-md-12 animation--up"]}}]},"rows":[{"columns":[{"mapSettings":{"lat":36.4272263,"lng":25.4257203,"center":[36.4272263,25.4257203],"zoom":12},"mapStyle":{"height":"500px"},"css":{"element":"div","class":"animation--up","color":"primary-dark"}}]}]},"5":{"wrapper":{"fluid":true,"css":{"border":"0","backgroundColor":"#04456D"},"rows":[{"css":{"padding":"80px 0 60px 0","border":"0","maxWidth":"1440px","margin":"0 auto"},"columns":{"sizes":["col-md-12  animation--up"]}}]},"rows":[{"columns":[{"text":"MORE HOTELS","link":{"pathname":"/dreams-luxury-suites","api":"/pages/room/room1"},"css":{"element":"div","class":"title-case-primary text-uppercase text-center animation--up","color":"primary-dark","maxWidth":"512px","margin":"0 auto","padding":"0 0 0 0"}}]}]},"idbName":"/pages/location","schema":"schema-location","SEO":{"title":"Location | Alta Vista Suites Santorini | Aqua Vista Hotels ","description":"Aqua Vista Hotel's Aliko Suite is located in the picturesque village of Imerovigli, Santorini. 2 km from the capital, Fira.
