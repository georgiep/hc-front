It is known throughout the world for its quiet life and fantastic sunset, and is certainly the most beautiful and picturesque village of Santorini. The village is also situated on top of an impressive cliff and offers a spectacular view over the volcano of Palia and Nea Kameni and the island of Thirassia. Oia is situated on the north of the island, 11 km away from Fira.</p>\n<p>It is a traditional village with charming houses in narrow streets, blue domed churches, and sun-bathed verandas. Its streets have plenty of tourist shops, taverns, cafes, and other shops. Oia is much more quiet that Fira and the busiest area is the main pedestrian that runs along its length. At the entrance of the village is a car park where visitors can leave their vehicle and enjoy long walks in the picturesque paths.</p>\n<p>The volcano from here is much less imposing but you can still get some gorgeous views. Oia has several cultural attractions like the Maritime Museum which houses a small library, items from the maritime life of the area, and the vestiges of a Venetian fortress. Many artists fell in love with the area and settled there. For that reason, the village of Oia has many art galleries.</p>\n<p>Oia also has a small port, Ammoudi, which can be reached by a set of 300 steps leading down. There, small boats can take you opposite, to the island of Thirassia. The beach of Armenis is also located there. Taverns in Oia offer visitors tasty meals of fresh fish.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"primary-dark title-case-secondary text-left\">Address</div>\n<div class=\"line-break\"></div>\n<div class=\"main-text-body primary-black\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\">Aplai Dome Santorini, Οία 847 02</div>\n","css":{"element":"div","class":"animation--up","color":"primary-dark"}}]}]},"4":{"wrapper":{"fluid":true,"css":{"border":"0","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF"},"rows":[{"css":{"padding":"80px 0 0 0","border":"0"},"columns":{"sizes":["col-md-12 animation--up"]}}]},"rows":[{"columns":[{"mapSettings":{"lat":36.4662905,"lng":25.3758582,"center":[36.4662905,25.3758582],"zoom":12},"mapStyle":{"height":"500px"},"css":{"element":"div","class":"animation--up","color":"primary-dark"}}]}]},"5":{"wrapper":{"fluid":true,"css":{"border":"0","backgroundColor":"#04456D"},"rows":[{"css":{"padding":"80px 0 60px 0","border":"0","maxWidth":"1440px","margin":"0 auto"},"columns":{"sizes":["col-md-12  animation--up"]}}]},"rows":[{"columns":[{"text":"MORE HOTELS","link":{"pathname":"/dreams-luxury-suites","api":"/pages/room/room1"},"css":{"element":"div","class":"title-case-primary text-uppercase text-center animation--up","color":"primary-dark","maxWidth":"512px","margin":"0 auto","padding":"0 0 0 0"}}]}]},"idbName":"/pages/location","schema":"schema-location","SEO":{"title":"Location | Aplai Dome Santorini | Aqua Vista Hotels ","description":"Aqua Vista Hotel's Aplai Dome Santorini is located in the quaint village of Oia, Santorini, with its port & art galleries.
