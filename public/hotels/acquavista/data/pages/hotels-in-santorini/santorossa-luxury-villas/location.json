Once a hub for trade (which is the name of the village), it has maintained its vibrant nature in absolute harmony with a much sought-after serenity. One of the highlights in Emporio is the fortified castle called Kasteli, dating back to the Medieval times. Within close distance lies the Tower of Nimborio, a watchtower and shelter used back in the days.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>The village is composed of quaint little neighborhoods and cobbled pathways, charming houses with fragrant gardens and hospitable locals who will greet you with a smile and invite you to be part of the long-lasting tradition of Emporio. It looks as if time stands still, as you are relishing scrumptious delicacies and sip on aromatic coffee or herbal tea. The views from the village are quite spectacular, too.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Due to its privileged location, Emporio provides smooth access to the famous beaches of Perissa and Perivolos, as well as the dune-like Vlychada beach.
