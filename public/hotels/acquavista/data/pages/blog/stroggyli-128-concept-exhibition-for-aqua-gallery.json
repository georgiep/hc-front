It is the island of Lava, the island with the only caldera in the world inhabited by the inner part of the volcano. The 30 artists were invited to create works inspired by the special character of the island, each corner of which is an Art. ”</p>\n<p>The exhibition “Stroggyli-128” will be presented from Saturday, August 24 until the end of the summer season at Aqua Gallery at Art Hotel Santorini.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vc_empty_space\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vc_row wpb_row section vc_row-fluid \">\n<div class=\" full_section_inner clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\">\n<div class=\"vc_column-inner\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>Get the most of it by combining  Art with Luxurity.
