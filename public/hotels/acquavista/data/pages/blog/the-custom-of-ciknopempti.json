Plagiarism and polytheism, characteristic of that day, are reminiscent of land-based practices that, when combined with Christian tradition, mean preparation for the Great Lent.</span></p>\n<p>According to the Orthodox tradition, in anticipation of Lent and observing the fasts of Wednesday and Friday, Cikno Thursday was placed between, as a day of relief with “nodding” and croaking.</p>\n<p>The ‘protocol’ also requires disguise and teasing. In the villages, people turn around from door to door, knocking on the doors of known and unknown people, demanding drink and wine, which was abundantly consumed and along the way, demanding that the housewives leave their homes and follow the hordes. The custom even includes “damage” to the exterior of the houses, where passersby throw the pots down to spill the soil in the yards, smear their faces, and the fun continues until morning.</p>\n<p>Over the course of time, each place developed its own special customs.</p>\n<p id=\"tw-target-text\" class=\"tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta\" dir=\"ltr\" data-placeholder=\"Μετάφραση\"><span lang=\"en\">In the Peloponnese, pork is slaughtered, after which traditional delicacies such as cloves, cigarettes, pastes and gourds are prepared.</span></p>\n<p id=\"tw-target-text\" class=\"tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta\" dir=\"ltr\" data-placeholder=\"Μετάφραση\"><span lang=\"en\">In Cyclades, engaged couples exchange as confessional, edible items.
