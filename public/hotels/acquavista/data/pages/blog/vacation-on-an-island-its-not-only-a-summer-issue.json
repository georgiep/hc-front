Maybe just because an evening walk  on the beach with the warm breeze on our shoulders seem idyllic.But how is going holiday on an island in winter?</p>\n<p>The beach may seem wild, but the scenery is breathtaking. The island is more glittering than ever, as it is resting from the summer season. The island is at its best. There are not so many people and the scenery is still magical. The beauty of the wild sea will amaze even the most skeptical. Island’s aura will always be beautiful.</p>\n<p>Who said we should always swim in the sea? The sea will give you so much beauty and energy that you don’t even have to swim, you can only smell it! On the other hand, winters in Greece have a lot of hot days, so you can always try swimming in a sea a little cooler than you used to!</p>\n<p>Many hotels stay open all year and offer great vacations even on the coldest days. One of them is the Asteras Villas Santorini. Seductive… Alluring… Fascinating… the Asteras Villas are just a precious jewel managed by a courteous team of extremely professional members that are there to put their touches in making your stay an even more memorable one…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aquavistahotels.com/hotels/asteras-villas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stroll around Asteras Villas.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2973\" src=\"https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_20191008-115223-600x600-1-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_20191008-115223-600x600-1-300x300.png 300w, https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_20191008-115223-600x600-1-150x150.png 150w, https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_20191008-115223-600x600-1-260x260.png 260w, https://greece-hotel.info/admins/aquavistahotels/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot_20191008-115223-600x600-1.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://aquavistahotels.com/our-hotels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stroll around our collection of fine hotels and villas</a></em></p>\n","css":{"element":"div","class":"main-text-body","color":"primary-black","heading":{"element":"div","class":"main-text-body animation--up","color":"primary-white"}}}]}]},"3":{"wrapper":{"fluid":false,"css":{"border":"0","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF"},"rows":[{"css":{"padding":"80px 0","border":"0"},"columns":{"sizes":["col-md-12 animation--up"]}}]},"rows":[{"columns":[{"items":[{"book_now":"","title":"WINDSURFING AT NAXOS","description":"Naxos offers Windsurfing without limits, as its is a paradise for beginners, experienced windsurfers and experts. ...","image":{"src":"https://code.rateparity.com/aquavistahotels.com/2022/12/Screenshot-14.png","alt":"alt image blog"},"excerpt":"Naxos offers Windsurfing without limits, as its is a paradise for beginners, experienced windsurfers and experts. ...","seo_title":"Windsurfing at Naxos  | Aqua Vista Hotels | Hotel Management Company","seo_description":"Naxos offers Windsurfing without limits, as its is a paradise for beginners, experienced windsurfers and experts.","keywords":"","link":{"pathname":"/blog/windsurfing-at-naxos","api":"/pages/room/room1","text":"Explore"}},{"book_now":"","title":"AUGUST 15TH IN PAROS","description":"This festival is a touching moment for the locals and certainly an unforgettable experience for the tourists....","image":{"src":"https://code.rateparity.com/aquavistahotels.com/2022/12/ekatontapylliani.png","alt":"alt image blog"},"excerpt":"This festival is a touching moment for the locals and certainly an unforgettable experience for the tourists....","seo_title":"August 15th in Paros | Aqua Vista Hotels | Hotel Management Company","seo_description":"This festival is a touching moment for the locals and certainly an unforgettable experience for the tourists.","keywords":"","link":{"pathname":"/blog/august-15th-in-paros","api":"/pages/room/room1","text":"Explore"}},{"book_now":"","title":"STROGGYLI 128 – CONCEPT EXHIBITION FOR AQUA GALLERY","description":"Restart Contemporary Art Platform helds Another interesting project that is designed specially for the Aqua Gallery by Art Hotel Santorini , member of Aqua Vista Hotels. ...","image":{"src":"https://code.rateparity.com/aquavistahotels.com/2022/12/Screensdddhot.png","alt":"alt image blog"},"excerpt":"Restart Contemporary Art Platform helds Another interesting project that is designed specially for the Aqua Gallery by Art Hotel Santorini , member of Aqua Vista Hotels. ...","seo_title":"STROGGYLI 128 -
